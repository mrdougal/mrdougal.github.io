    At first I started <a href="http://instagram.com/15mindrawings">15mindrawings</a> as a way to entertain our three year old son, 
    but it has envoled into a daily habit with a global audience.

About five times a week I publish drawings on **[instagram](http://instagram.com/15mindrawings)**, as a way to relax and 
rediscover my love for drawing. I have illustrated for [ruby conference australia](http://rubyconf.org.au) and have had my work published in [a list a part](http://alistapart.com)

I also have [a twitter account](http://twitter.com/15mindrawings) and [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/15mindrawings) *but these are mainly mirrors of my instagram content*. There is [a store on redbubble](http://bit.ly/15mindrawings-store) where you can buy selected artworks printed on a wide range of goods.
