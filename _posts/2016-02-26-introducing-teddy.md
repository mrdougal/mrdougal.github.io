My first published book that i illustrated for [Jessica Walton](http://wwww.jessicawalton.com.au), this book started out as a kickstarter campaign that took over the world. The book is being published globally in english by [Bloomsbury](http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/introducing-teddy-9781408877630/) and is being translated into 9 different languages.


> MacPhersonâ€™s ink-and-watercolor illustrations are striking for their emotional immediacy and compositional polish
