#15 min drawings

My side project which I started in April as a way of entertaining my son on a rainy sunday afternoon. To entertain our son I thought we could do some colouring in. So i drew some of his favourite things, the squeals of excitement as i created a digger in front of his eyes was infectious. He didn't want to colour in, he just wanted me to draw more for him. So I drew another digger, and then a dump truck.

The following morning our son came into our bedroom clutching the crude drawings from the previous day, and was very excitedly telling us about the diggers, and the dump truck. At that moment that I knew I was going to be doing more drawings.


I have [a store on redbubble](http://bit.ly/15mindrawings-store) where you can buy a selected artworks printed on a wide range of goods.

I publish my drawings on [instagram](http://instagram.com/15mindrawings) about 3-4 times a week. I also have [a twitter account](http://twitter.com/15mindrawings) which is mainly a mirror of instagrams content.
