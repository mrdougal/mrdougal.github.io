# Dougal MacPherson
Frontend developer

I'm [@mrdougal](https://twitter.com/mrdougal) on twitter. 
You can email me at dougal.macpherson@me.com.
Or call my mobile on +64 21 167 5423. I live in New Zealand so we might need to [parse time-zones](https://everytimezone.com/)


My career goal has always been to create websites that delight the user. Most will think of this as flashy graphics or the latest “design tend,” but for me it’s having the user be in control and empowered regardless of their abilities or the device they’re using. Whizzy visuals, animations, and so on might be part of the experience, but never at the expense of accessibility and performance.

Although my main role these days is coding (I’ve described coding as like playing with Lego), a long time ago I worked as a designer. I still find my design skills, combined with my tech knowledge, can help inform the design and overall user experience. I’ve been called a “design linter” by co-workers.

For the past three years, I’ve been writing single-page JavaScript applications in React.
I enjoy using React, as it enables me to compose and build out user interfaces with code that feels solid, and that I can write comprehensive tests against. As you know, validation through testing is an ideal practice in JavaScript development. Before React, writing testable JavaScript code was often too difficult or otherwise impractical.



## Why I’d love to work for Automattic

Automattic is a rare company that has extraordinary reach, yet isn’t creepy (like so many other tech companies). It’s a company I’d be proud to work for. I’d often thought that for business to have scale and profitability, something would have to give, and so frequently that’s been user privacy. 

Frankly, the thought of working on WordPress, which is used by so many worldwide, feels like a privilege, and adds meaning to the work.

I’ve been working remotely for a tech startup for the past 10 months, and I’ve really enjoyed it.
Knowing that Automattic is a 100% remote company, having a culture where remote is the norm and not something weird, is super appealing. 


In my spare time, I illustrate the articles published on [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/). I enjoy being able to combine and leverage my drawing and coding skills in a way that boosts engagement with the articles.

## Experience

### Xplor
I worked remotely for a startup in Melbourne Australia that’s focused on improving education in preschools.

Challenges of the role
* Building an interface that bridges our main system and an Australian government interface so parents can receive rebates back from the government. 
* Creating and maintaining several React.js codebases
* Extracting shared components/functionality into npm modules to improve the consistency of the user experience, as well as allowing us to move quicker



### REA group
I worked on a large Ruby on Rails codebase, and several smaller Javascript “single page apps” 

Challenges of the role
* Gently refactoring a large Rails codebase to changing business requirements
* Developing new “single page applications” in react/redux
* As a UI developer
  * Building for mobile first, (when designs often aren’t adapted to mobile)
  * Championing accessibility over “design trends”
  * Extracting style guides and css/sass from designs

### Pop!

Pop! was mobile-focused startup, where I worked as their senior web developer. My role included writing a lot of JavaScript and working closely with the iOS and Android teams. Some of challenges of the job included…

* Building a node.js/socket.io messaging service that coordinated traffic between our native (iOS and Android) clients and a JavaScript “widget” embedded on a webpage. The interesting challenges in building this system…
  * Testing, and deploying a complicated system that doesn’t behave like a normal web service
  * Adapting a complicated system to rapidly changing business requirements
* Development of a JavaScript “widget”, that was embedded into third party websites. The technical challenges involved…
  * Not using external libraries, as we didn’t want to conflict with any existing JavaScript on the host page
  * Testing across multiple browsers on desktop and mobile
* Development of a browser plugin that injected our “widget” into web pages to enable our functionality. The challenges were mainly…
  * Maintaining one codebase for Chrome, Safari and Firefox
  * Honouring differing security requirements of each browser vendor

> Pop! have since pivoted and now call themselves [fillr](https://www.fillr.com/)

### jTribe

Before Pop! I worked for jTribe, a mobile app development firm specialising in iOS and Android development. I headed up the server and mobile web team, where my role was mainly…

* Building APIs for consumption by the phones.
* Building admin websites to massage data into the API's.
* Client-side web development
  * Mobile optimised websites
  * Client-side JavaScript applications

Prior to working at jTribe, I had my own consultancy, where I worked alongside several small design and advertising companies in Melbourne Australia as their “technical website person.”
