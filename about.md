<!-- ![Dougal MacPherson](/img/dougal-macpherson.jpg) -->

Dougal MacPherson is a [fine gentleman](http://twitter.com/mrdougal "You should follow my on twitter, it will change your life") and lead father figure to his small family in Melbourne Australia.

Some people have called me a [senior web developer](http://github.com/mrdougal "If you want to have a poke at some of my code, including the code for this site")
*quite possibly because I was born in the mid '70s*, others have told me I really should [illustrate children's books](/projects/15mindrawings "The illustrations that I do when i'm not being a programmer or a parent").
